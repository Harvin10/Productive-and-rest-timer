# Productive-and-rest-timer
This timer is based on a youtube video that I watch from a lecture

We will have focus around 25 to 30 seconds and recharge the focus only for around five second. To study or work effectively, we could follow this timer and over time the 25 to 30 second can increase and so the timer. 

Play/pause the timer
Set a group of productive, rest, and total time to be saved
